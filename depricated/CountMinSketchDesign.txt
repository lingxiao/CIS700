so I'd have some big nested record Record a b = R a b
Cale
At the same time, this gives you an opportunity to control how state gets updated -- maybe you just want the user to set it freely, but sometimes not every state is really valid and you'd like to make sure they build it up in a sane way.

and putFoo and putBar operate on it?

It can be nested or flat

Well, yeah, that'll be in the instance of your new type class.

For the monad type you construct (possibly using StateT)

hpc programming languages and software development is one of the few fields where people seem determined to leave things to subjectivity

vektor, it might be less tedious than the other way, which requires deling into ghc-api

lingxiao
im hesitant to declare new typeclass because it seems like "overdesing"
Cale
Well, this is sort of an intermediate step
lingxiao
wait you're saying declare a new type class  right?
Cale
yes
OB1TO has left IRC ()
Cale
But you're right, it's questionable whether having that type class in itself is a bit much
lingxiao
see another issue here is that once i compute the parameters ... they really should be read only
rvxi
hpc maybe because there's such a high cost to learning, there's an inherent conflict of interest
lingxiao
yeah my attitude w/ typeclasses is that if I can't find it in a paper somewhere it's prob not worth it :D

How can i make IntList an instance of Traversable?

hpc the other day, i was talking to someone who couldn't understand how matlab could be a bad language when "you get so much done"
lingxiao
but I dont know how to do what you had initally suggeested ... everyting will be lifted into conduitM
Cale
lingxiao: So, you can do things at the type level to try to ensure client code can't even *try* to set something more than once, but that takes you out of the realm of ordinary monads into something like indexed monads.
lingxiao
so i wnt something like     source ~> initPram ~> initStore ~> update
archmonk has joined (~archmonk@c-50-174-16-226.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
lingxiao
indexed monads heh maybe another day
Cale
However, as an intermediate level of safety, defining this type class of operations will let you do runtime checks
vektor
geekosaur: I know :D Then again, there's easy to use tools like haskell-src-exts. I've already thought, maybe the output of ghci is in a format that Language.Haskell.Exts.Parser can parse.
hpc
rvxi: i have had a similar revelation about spreadsheets (which makes me want to retry learning frp but that's another story)
Cale
Because you get to define the setters to check whether the thing is already set, and perhaps throw an exception or something.

hpc
and it's not hard when you're good at it, but there's many pitfalls
emilypi has left IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
Cale
But yeah, then the next step is to decide whether you really need the type class, or whether you might be better off just using a record data type with fields for each of the operations of what would have been your class.

hpc you can have a short OODA loop you can get with repl/spreadsheet workflows. haskell should have  a better R Shiny  type of solution to bury that type of competition.

yeah

This can be cool if you're ultimately just going to implement the thing over IO, because you can just implement the getters and setters in terms of IORef or something then
Cale
But you still get the nice abstraction where you have types like:

hpc R is still >> matlab (although this person thought matlab was superior due to performance). i'm starting to get weary of the dynamic programming bugs in R code. R can seem much worse than it is because it attracts really bad programmers.
hpc
rvxi: i would be more generous, it attracts non-programmers
Cale
So, you'd have something like  data Some m = Some { getFoo :: m Foo, setFoo :: Foo -> m (), ... }

ive been converting a spreadsheet to sql and using it as an excuse to finally use views and procedures

and then you can write an IO action which builds a Some IO record by making some IORefs, or you can write a more pure one which uses StateT
